== Overview

This is a JGitflow Gradle Plugin which supports the Gitflow Workflow. It uses `org.eclipse.jgit` and `com.atlassian.jgitflow:jgit-flow-core` to implement the Gitflow Workflow. The project is inspired by the http://jgitflow.bitbucket.org/[JGitFlow Maven Plugin].
The Plugin adds the following tasks under a group called "jgitflow":

* releaseStart: Creates a release branch and updates the gradle.properties file with a release version
* releaseFinish: Merges the release branch into the master branch and develop branch

The project requires at least JDK 7.

== Usage Guide

Add the following snippet to your Gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.github.robwin:jgitflow-gradle-plugin:{version}'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'io.github.robwin.jgitflow'
----

The default Gitflow configuration looks as follows:

.Branch names
[options="header"]
|===
|Logical branch name | Real branch name
|master | "master"
|develop | "develop"
|feature | "feature/<featureName>"
|release | "release/<releaseVersion>"
|hotfix | "hotfix/<hotfixName>";
|===

By default the release tag has no version prefix.

=== Release Start Task

The plugin adds a task named `releaseStart`. The task checks that the current project version is a snapshot version, e.g. `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, and that no snapshot library dependencies are used.
It creates a release branch `releases/<releaseVersion>` and updates the `gradle.properties` file with a release version.
The task exposes a few properties as part of its configuration.

.Properties of releaseStart
[options="header"]
|===
|Property | Description | Type | Default
|releaseVersion | The version of the release |  String | empty
|allowSnapshotDependencies| Allow snapshot library dependencies | Boolean| false
|===

==== Example

The tasks should be invoked via a command line.

`gradlew releaseStart -PreleaseVersion=1.0.0`

=== Release Finish Task

The plugin adds a task named `releaseFinish`. The task merges the release branch into the master branch and develop branch.

==== Example

The tasks should be invoked via a command line.

`gradlew releaseFinish`
